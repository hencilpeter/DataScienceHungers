Questions from the Housing Sale Price Prediction Project
========================================================
- define hypothesis and ANOVA clearly.
 - missing steps 
 - how taking log fixes skewness 
 - how to fix kurtocis 
 - should we remove the missing columns in test data from the training dataset at the beining ? 
 - correlationship - what variabels should we pick? top 10 and bottom 10 ? or similar criteria 
 -  when target variable is skewed why should we take correlated variables medium value (it says roubust to outliers)?
 - mean and median (pivot and statement) mixed. is it wrong in blog?
 -  ANOVA more detail 
     Does ANOVA can be used for median/mode/etc
	 what is exact/indepth meaning of significance difference
	 double in function - why are we appending the saleprice group before feeding the values to anova function? instead directly feed the values?  
	 disparity computation
 -  why box plot for categorical variable 
 - box plot - detect outliers
 -  why GarageYrBlt columns nan is set to median ? may be numeric value
 near-zero variance distribution
 - groupy by usign train ds but assinged to allData
 - is dataframe implicit conversion in pandas?
 -  all the reauired charts must be studied
